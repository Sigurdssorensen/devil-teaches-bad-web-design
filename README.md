# devil-teaches-bad-web-design

## What this repository is
This repository showcases the final deliverable in the course Introduction to Web Design at the University of Queensland.
The course required us to not use any package managers or compilers, so I decided to learn the restrictions and workarounds 
of converting a vue.js npm project to a cdn based vue.js project. Please see the design report and brief for more information 
regarding this project.

## Live Demo
When you encounter the login form, please do not log in with your personal credentials, but rather come up with some temporary credentials. 
You need to remember these credentials further down the line, so make them easy to remember.

## Original Codebase
Due to the course restrictions, I had to convert the npm based project to this cdn based version.
Given that the code was written to be converted to a cdn version, the original codebase does not
follow the standard conventions as expected with Vue.js.
