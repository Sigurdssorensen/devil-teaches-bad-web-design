# devil-teaches-bad-web-design

## What this repository is
This repository showcases the final deliverable in the course Introduction to Web Design at the University of Queensland.
The course required us to not use any package managers or compilers, so I decided to learn the restrictions and workarounds 
of converting a vue.js npm project to a cdn based vue.js project. Please see the design report and brief for more information 
regarding this project.

You need to remember these credentials further down the line, so make them easy to remember.
